# Starting with Docker

From the Docker website, we can find this description:

> Docker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized uint for software development.

What this means is Docker allows you to create an individual container that contains all the necessary components your application needs to run: from the code, to the filesystem, and libraries. The app will be mostly segregated from the existing operating system, but all containers will share the same kernel. It differs from a virtual machine because it doesn't boot up another operating system. It's a process like the others than run on your server.
